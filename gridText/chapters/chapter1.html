            <h2>XXVII</h2>
                <p>
                  
                    And now six years have already gone by... I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive. I was sad, but I told them: 
                </p>
                <p>
                     "I am tired."
                 </p>
                 <p>
            
                    Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say--not entirely. But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak. It was not such a heavy body... and at night I love to listen to the stars. It is like five hundred million little bells...

                    But there is one extraordinary thing... when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep. So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet? Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower...

                    At one time I say to myself: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "Surely not! The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully..." 
                </p>
                 <p>
                    Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.

                    But at another time I say to myself: 
                </p>
                <p>
                    "At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough! On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night..." </p>
                <p>
                
                    And then the little bells are changed to tears...

                    Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has--yes or no?--eaten a rose...

                    Look up at the sky. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ask yourselves: is it yes or no?
                </p>
                <p>
                   Has the sheep eaten the flower? And you will see how everything changes...
                 </p>
                 <p>
        
                    And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance!    
                </p>
