                        I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this <br>
                        was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely<br>
                        any larger than a house! <br>
                        But that did not really surprise me much.<br>
                        <br>
                        I knew very well that in addition to the great planets— such <br>
                        as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus— to which we have given <br>
                        names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which <br>
                        are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through <br>
                        the telescope.<br>
                        <br> 
                        When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not<br>
                        give it a name, but only a number. <br>
                        He might call it, for example, “Asteroid 325.”<br>
                        On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to <br>
                        the International Astronomical Congress, in a great <br>
                        demonstration.<br>
                        But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would <br>
                        believe what he said.<br>

                        a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain <br> 
                        of death, should change to European costume. <br> 
                        So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again,<br>
                        dressed with impressive style and elegance. <br>
                        <br>

                    <br>

                    It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils.<br>
                    It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and
                    the <u>boa constrictor</u> from the inside, since I was six.<br>
                    I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible.<br>
                    But I am not at all sure of success.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject. <br>
                    I make some errors, too, in the little prince’s height:<br>
                    in one place he is too tall and in another too short. <br>
                    And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume.<br>
                    So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope
                    generally fair-to-middling.<br>
                    <br>
                    In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. <br>
                    But that is something that will not be my fault. <br>
                    My friend never explained anything to me. He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself.<br> 
                    But I, also, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes. <br>
                    .<br>
                    .<br>
                    Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups.
